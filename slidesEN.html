    <p>Application of CFD Analysis in Bearings</p>

    <aside class="notes">
        In bearings, we use CFD analysis to help us design better products because it helps us see how fluids move. This
        is an example of CFD analysis of fluid inside bearings that our company has done before. As you can see, we can
        visualize where grease distributes, and we can also study things that are hard to visualize, like heat from
        friction and how that makes the viscosity decrease. But CFD analysis takes a very long time to calculate. For
        example,
        in this calculation, it takes several seconds to reach a steady state, which still needs several days
        in real time. This means it's not good when we want to test many different designs in the early stages of
        development.

    <p>BASIC IDEA: Learn CFD results with AI to replace CFD</p>
    <aside class="notes">
        So, people have started looking for ways to use AI to make CFD calculations faster and cheaper. Here's the basic
        idea: we run expensive CFD calculations first and use those results to teach AI. Then the AI can work like a
        replacement for CFD. This can make CFD calculations much faster. The AI can predict the same things as CFD but
        in much less time.

    <aside class="notes">
        DL-ROM stands for Deep Learning for Reduced Order Modelling, and is a method for creating reduced-order models
        using deep learning. As shown in this figure, DL-ROM has three main parts. First, there is an encoder that makes
        the fluid state smaller. Next, there is a part that moves the smaller state forward in time. Finally, there is a
        decoder that makes the time-moved state big again. By putting these three parts together, DL-ROM can predict
        fluid states quickly and well.

    <aside class="notes">
        1. The data that DL-ROM works with is like a 3D grid - it has 2D space plus time as the third dimension.<br>
        2. The special feature of DL-ROM is that it can calculate how the fluid changes over time. It learns from past
        fluid states to predict future states.<br>
        3.1. But DL-ROM has some rules we need to follow. First, the number of grid points must stay the same - we can't
        increase or decrease grid points during calculations.<br>
        3.2. Also, the data shape must be rectangular, like a picture. This is because we use the same type of neural
        networks that are used to recognize images.<br>
        3.3. And finally, we need to have values everywhere inside the boundaries. Boundaries are areas where there's no
        fluid, like the solid parts of the cylinder shown in this figure.

    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        Let me explain in more detail using specific numbers.<br>
        1. First, we use 10 fluid snapshots as input to DL-ROM.<br>
        2. For example, if each snapshot has 2D data with 320×80 grid points, putting 10 snapshots together gives us
        data with shape like this.<br>
        3. This data gets squeezed down by the encoder into a much smaller vector with shape 32. This
        small vector contains all the important information about what the fluid will do next.<br>
        4. Then, this vector gets expanded back by the decoder to data with shape same as one snapshot<br>
        5. for the next time step.

        × 5</p>
    <aside class="notes">
        Now let me show you the specific network design of DL-ROM. The encoder consists of 5 convolutional layers, batch
        normalization layers, and activation layers. This compresses input data and generates low-dimensional
        feature vectors. On the other hand, the decoder consists of 5 transposed convolutional layers, batch
        normalization layers, and activation layers. This expands feature vectors back to their original shape
        and predicts fluid states at the next time step.

        To be honest, all the explanation so far has been about existing research, and the original part of this study

        In this study, we looked at fluid flow in 2D bearing cavities. As you can see in this figure, we studied fluid
        that flows in a ring shape, just like what happens inside bearings. We used commercial CFD software to
        calculate. The left animation shows how the fluid behaves according to CFD calculations, and the right

        Let me explain the data preprocessing.<br>
        1. The fluid was single-phase Newtonian with Reynolds number 400.<br>
        2. We got vorticity data from CFD, which we made normal with mean 0 and variance 1.<br>
        3. We filled the solid parts with zeros.<br>
        4. We also made the coordinate system rotate to keep the ball in the same place. This is because it's hard for
        the AI to learn when the boundary conditions keep changing.<br>
        5. Also, we changed the cylinder shape data into rectangle shape using polar coordinates. This is the most
        important data preparation step in this study. This lets us meet the rectangle data shape rule that DL-ROM
        needs.

        Here we explain how we split the data and how we trained and tested the model.<br>
        1. We used 1000 snapshots from the CFD run. From these, 800 snapshots were used for training the model and 200
        were used for testing it.<br>
        2. The model takes 10 snapshots as input and tries to predict the 11th snapshot. During training, the model
        starts with random weights and then changes those weights step by step so its predictions get closer to the real
        CFD results.<br>
        3. During testing, we do not change the model — we only check how well its predictions match the real
        snapshots.<br>
        4. To measure the difference between the model and the CFD results, we used mean squared error (MSE). This
        number tells us, on average, how far the predicted values are from the real values.
        The training process reduces the MSE, showing that the model learns to make better predictions.

    <aside class="notes">
        This shows the training results. The right graph shows how the error changes as we train the model.
        The horizontal axis shows training epochs, and the vertical axis shows MSE. The blue line shows
        error for training data, and the green line shows error for test data. We can see that the error for both
        datasets goes down as training moves forward. This means that DL-ROM is getting better at predicting fluid
        behavior. While the training data error decreases smoothly, the test data error goes up slightly in some parts.
        This is a sign of overfitting, but since both errors end up at similar levels, we think serious overfitting
        did not happen. We used GPU for training and testing. The computer specs are shown here. Training took about
        10 hours and used about 100MB of memory.

    <aside class="notes">
        This shows the results of fluid simulation by DL-ROM. The top row shows CFD results, the middle
        row shows DL-ROM predictions, and the bottom row shows the differences between them. As you can see,
        DL-ROM predictions match very well with CFD results. Looking at the differences at the bottom, we can
        see that the differences are small in most areas.<br>
        Also, on the right we show how the error changes at each time step. As we expected, the error slowly gets bigger
        over time. This is because DL-ROM uses its own predictions as input for the next step, so small errors pile up.
        But overall, it keeps the errors low, which shows that DL-ROM can predict fluid behavior very accurately.<br>
        Also, please look at the calculation time. While CFD took about 800 minutes to calculate 1 second of fluid
        behavior, DL-ROM could do the same job in about 3 minutes. This means it's 260 times faster.<br>
        Such fast calculations let engineers try many more design ideas in the early stages of bearing development.

        Here is a summary of what we achieved. In this study, we successfully applied DL-ROM to 2D bearing fluid.
        For future work, we have several exciting directions. First, we want to apply this to 3D bearing fluid. Second,
        we want to work with non-Newtonian fluids and flows that have both gas and liquid. Finally, we want to find
        better ways to handle the solid parts inside the boundaries, instead of just filling them with zeros. This
        should make DL-ROM more accurate and useful for more situations. This concludes my presentation. Thank you for
        your attention.
