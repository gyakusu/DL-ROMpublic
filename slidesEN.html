    <aside class="notes">
        In bearings, CFD analysis is useful for design studies because it can provide detailed understanding of fluid
        behavior. This is an example of CFD analysis of fluid within bearings that our company published previously. As
        you can see, we can visualize phenomena such as where grease accumulates in detail, and we can also analyze
        phenomena that are difficult to visualize, such as shear heating and resulting viscosity reduction. However, CFD
        analysis has high computational costs. For example, in the calculation shown in this figure, it takes several
        seconds to reach steady state, which still requires several days in real time. Therefore, it can take days to
        weeks to analyze one second of fluid behavior. Therefore, it is not suitable when we want to examine many
        parameters in the early stages of design studies.

    <p>Reducing CFD computational cost using AI</p>
    <aside class="notes">
        Therefore, methods that use AI to reduce CFD computational costs have been attracting attention in recent years.
        By executing computationally expensive CFD in advance and using the results to train AI, the AI functions as a
        substitute for CFD. This can significantly reduce CFD computational costs. Specifically, we can predict the same
        outputs as CFD - flow velocity and pressure distributions - in much shorter time than CFD.

        For example, let me explain using the DL-ROM that I implemented. This is a method that uses deep learning to
        learn fluid motion patterns and create substitutes for governing equations. In this method, we train a deep
        learning model using fluid behavior calculated by CFD. After training, the deep learning model functions as a

        post-processing. Each of these methods has its own characteristics and needs to be selected according to the
        problem being applied. This review paper was published by researchers from China, and it is very clear and

        DL-ROM stands for Deep Learning for Reduced Order Modelling, and is a method for creating reduced-order models
        using deep learning. As shown in this figure, DL-ROM mainly consists of three parts. First, there is an encoder
        that compresses the fluid state. Next, there is a part that evolves the compressed state in time. Finally, there
        is a decoder that expands the time-evolved state back to its original shape. By combining these three parts,
        DL-ROM efficiently predicts fluid states.

    <aside class="notes">
        The data handled by DL-ROM is 3D grid data with 2D space and 1D time. A characteristic feature of DL-ROM is that
        it performs time evolution calculations. On the other hand, DL-ROM has several constraints. First, the grid
        number must be constant. We cannot increase or decrease the grid number during calculations. Also, the data
        shape must be rectangular. This is because we use convolutional neural networks that are used in image
        recognition. Furthermore, values must exist inside boundaries. Boundaries refer to non-fluid regions such as the
        cylinder and its interior in this figure. We need to prepare data to satisfy these constraints.

    <aside class="notes">
        Let me explain in more detail using specific data. First, we use 10 fluid snapshots as input to DL-ROM. For
        example, if each snapshot has a 2D data with 320×80 grid points, combining 10 snapshots results in data with
        shape 320×80×10. This data is compressed by the encoder into a vector with shape 32. This vector contains
        learned information about the fluid at the next time step. Next, this vector is expanded by the decoder back to
        data with shape 320×80×1. This outputs one fluid snapshot for the next time step.

    <aside class="notes">
        Finally, let me explain the specific network architecture of DL-ROM. As shown in this figure, DL-ROM consists of
        an encoder and decoder. The encoder consists of 5 convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, and
        activation function layers. This compresses input data and generates low-dimensional feature vectors. On the
        other hand, the decoder consists of 5 transposed convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, and
        activation function layers. This expands feature vectors back to their original shape and predicts fluid states
        at the next time step.

    <aside class="notes">
        We targeted single-phase Newtonian fluid with Reynolds number 400. This Reynolds number was chosen to match
        previous research and because vortices were most clearly visible at this value. Since the inner ring has the
        highest
        velocity, we defined the Reynolds number using this velocity, bearing dimensions, and fluid viscosity. CFD
        output fluid vorticity, which was normalized to have mean 0 and variance 1. Interior boundaries were represented
        by zero-filling. We also rotated the coordinate system to fix the ball position. This is because learning
        becomes difficult when boundary conditions change over time. Furthermore, we converted cylindrical shape data to
        rectangular data using polar coordinates. This is the most important preprocessing in this study. This allows us
        to satisfy the rectangular data shape constraint of DL-ROM. By performing this preprocessing, we prepared data
        to satisfy DL-ROM constraints.

        This shows the data split method used for training and evaluation. As shown in the left graph, we used 1000
        snapshots after increasing Reynolds number from rest and reaching stable flow. For training and evaluation, we
        split the 1000 snapshots into 800 training data and 200 evaluation data. The number of training and test data
        was also matched to previous research. Indeed, this number was sufficient for this study. Since DL-ROM predicts
        the 11th snapshot from 10 inputs, in training we made DL-ROM learn so its predictions match the actual 11th
        data. That is,
        initially predictions are far off because weights are given randomly, but as training progresses, weight
        parameters are updated and predictions approach actual data. On the other hand, in evaluation we assessed how
        well DL-ROM predictions match actual data. Specifically, we made DL-ROM predict using evaluation data and
        calculated the difference between predictions and actual data. We used mean squared error as the evaluation
        metric. This represents the mean of squared differences between vorticity calculated by CFD and vorticity
        predicted by DL-ROM. The calculation formula is shown at the bottom right.

        This shows the training results. The right graph shows the change in mean squared error with training progress.
        The horizontal axis is training epochs, and the vertical axis is mean squared error. The blue line shows mean
        squared error for training data, and the orange line shows mean squared error for evaluation data. We can see
        that mean squared error for both datasets decreases as training progresses. This indicates that DL-ROM is
        becoming able to accurately predict fluid behavior. While train data decreases smoothly, test data increases
        slightly in some parts. This is a sign of overfitting, but since both MSEs finally converge to similar levels,
        we believe significant overfitting did not occur. We used GPU for training and testing. The specifications are
        as
        follows. Training took about 10 hours with memory usage of about 100MB. The hardware used as described here.

        This shows the results of fluid simulation by DL-ROM. The upper row on the left shows CFD results, the middle
        row shows DL-ROM predictions, and the lower row shows their differences. As you can see, DL-ROM predictions
        agree very well with CFD results. Looking at the differences below, we can see that differences are small in
        most regions. However, there are some areas where differences are large. This is considered to be because DL-ROM
        tried to predict fluid behavior it had not learned. Also, on the right we show mean squared error at each time
        step. As expected, error gradually increases over time. This is because DL-ROM predictions are used as input for
        the next time step, so errors accumulate. On the other hand, it maintains low values overall, indicating that
        DL-ROM can predict fluid behavior with high accuracy. We believe it can maintain within the engineering
        acceptable error range of below 5% for at least 3 cycles. Furthermore, please note the calculation time. While
        CFD took about 800 minutes to analyze 1 second of fluid behavior, DL-ROM could perform the same analysis in
        about 3 minutes. This achieved a 260× speedup. This represents a significant breakthrough where calculations
        that previously took days can now be completed in hours, opening up possibilities for practical design
        applications. Such dramatic speedup enables engineers to explore many more design parameters in the early stages
        of bearing development, potentially revolutionizing our design process.

        What was obtained in this study includes, first, applying DL-ROM to 2D bearing fluid. We represented cylindrical
        space in polar coordinates and used convolutional neural networks for images. Next, for training evaluation
        conditions, we targeted single-phase Newtonian fluid with Reynolds number Re of 400, represented interior
        boundaries with zero-filling, and learned fluid vorticity. Finally, for training results, we predicted the next
        time step from CFD input and achieved a 260× speedup.
        Future prospects include, first, application to 3D bearing fluid. This will enable prediction of more realistic
        bearing fluid behavior. Next, application to non-Newtonian fluids and gas-liquid multiphase flows. This will
        enable prediction of more complex fluid behavior such as grease. Finally, consideration of representation
        methods other than zero-filling for interior boundaries. This is expected to improve DL-ROM accuracy and expand
        its application range. This concludes my presentation. Thank you for your attention.
