    Biography (English):

    Koji Kususaki is a Data Science Engineer at NSK Ltd., where he has worked since 2017. He received an M.S.
    in Physics (specializing in Quantum Optics) from Waseda University (2015–2017). At NSK, his work focuses
    primarily on multibody dynamics and machine learning.
Long abstract (English):

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is widely used across mechanical design, environmental, and biomedical engineering to improve physical understanding and support design optimization, and it has been applied extensively to bearing design for lubricant behavior and shape optimization [1,2]. However, the large computational cost of high-fidelity CFD limits its suitability for iterative optimization workflows. Recently, deep learning (DL) techniques have been investigated to accelerate CFD-based analysis [3,4]. In this study, we apply the Deep Learning—Reduced Order Modelling (DL-ROM) framework proposed by Pant et al. [3] to predict flow inside a 2D bearing cavity and thereby accelerate vorticity field prediction. Vorticity snapshots (single-phase Newtonian fluid, Re = 400) computed by commercial CFD were normalized and preprocessed: interior solid regions were zero-filled, cylindrical geometry was mapped to a rectangular grid via polar coordinates, and a rotating coordinate frame was used to fix the ball location. The DL-ROM uses a convolutional encoder to compress ten consecutive snapshots (shape 320×80×10) to a 32-dimensional latent vector, a learned temporal evolution operator to advance the latent state, and a convolutional decoder to reconstruct the next snapshot. The model was trained on 800 snapshots and evaluated on 200, using variance-normalized mean squared error (MSE) as the metric. The trained DL-ROM reproduces CFD vorticity fields with small error while achieving approximately a 260× speedup (≈3 min vs ≈800 min per 1 s of simulation). This acceleration enables rapid parametric exploration in bearing design. Future work will extend the approach to 3D geometries, non-Newtonian and multiphase flows, and more sophisticated treatments of interior boundaries.

Short abstract (English):

We demonstrate a DL-ROM approach to accelerate prediction of vorticity in a 2D bearing cavity. By mapping CFD vorticity into rectangular image-like data, using a convolutional encoder–latent-time-evolution–decoder architecture trained on CFD snapshots (Re = 400), the model reproduces CFD results with low error and achieves ~260× speedup, enabling faster design exploration for bearings [1–4].

Long Abstract (日本語):
数値流体力学（CFD）は機械設計や環境工学，生体工学など幅広い分野で現象理解や設計最適化に活用されており，軸受設計においても潤滑油やグリースの挙動理解，形状最適化などに広く用いられています。しかし，軸受内部のような複雑な流れ場の解析には多大な計算時間が必要となり，繰り返し計算を要する最適化問題への適用は困難です。近年，この課題を解決する手法として，深層学習（Deep Learning, DL）を用いた流体解析の高速化が注目されています。本研究では，Pantらが提案した深層学習ベース低次元化モデル（DL-ROM）フレームワークを軸受内部流れの予測に適用し，2次元軸受空洞内で生じる流れ場（渦度）の予測を高速化した事例について報告します。

    <aside class="notes">
        In bearings, we use CFD analysis to help us design better products because it helps us visualize how fluids
        move. This is an example of CFD analysis of fluid inside bearings that our company has done before. As you can
        see, we can visualize where grease distributes, and we can also study things that are hard to visualize, like
        heat from friction and how that makes the viscosity decrease.<br>
        1. But CFD analysis takes a very long time to calculate. For example,
        in this calculation, it takes several seconds to reach a steady state, which still needs several days
        in real time. This means it's not good when we want to test many different designs in the early stages of
        development.

        So, people have started looking for ways to use AI to make CFD calculations faster and cheaper. Here's the basic
        idea: we run expensive CFD calculations first and use those results to teach AI. Then the AI can work like a
        replacement for CFD. This can make CFD calculations much faster. The AI can predict the same things as CFD but
        in much less time.

    <aside class="notes">
        DL-ROM stands for Deep Learning for Reduced Order Modelling, and is a method for creating reduced-order models
        using deep learning. As shown in this figure, DL-ROM has three main parts. First, there is an encoder that makes
        the fluid state smaller. Next, there is a part that moves the smaller state forward in time. Finally, there is a
        decoder that makes the time-moved state big again. By putting these three parts together, DL-ROM can predict
        fluid states quickly and well.

    <aside class="notes">
        1. The data that DL-ROM works with is like a 3D grid - it has 2D space plus time as the third dimension.<br>
        2. The special feature of DL-ROM is that it can calculate how the fluid changes over time. It learns from past
        fluid states to predict future states.<br>
        3.1. But DL-ROM has some rules we need to follow. First, the number of grid points must stay the same - we can't
        increase or decrease grid points during calculations.<br>
        3.2. Also, the data shape must be rectangular, like a picture. This is because we use the same type of neural
        networks that are used for image recognition.<br>
        3.3. And finally, we need to have values everywhere inside the boundaries. Boundaries are areas where there's no
        fluid, like the solid parts of the cylinder shown in this figure.

    </ul>
    <aside class="notes">
        Let me explain in more detail using specific numbers.<br>
        1. First, we use 10 fluid snapshots as input to DL-ROM.<br>
        2. For example, if each snapshot has 2D data with 320×80 grid points, putting 10 snapshots together gives us
        data with shape like this 3 dimension.<br>
        3. This data gets squeezed down by the encoder into a much smaller vector with shape 32. This
        small vector contains all the important information about what the fluid will do next.<br>
        4. Then, this vector gets expanded back by the decoder to data with shape same as one snapshot<br>
        5. for the next time step.

    <p>(Convolution・Normalization・Activation) × 5 → (Transposed convolution・Normalization・Activation)
        × 5</p>
    <aside class="notes">
        Now let me show you the specific network design of DL-ROM. The encoder consists of 5 convolutional layers, batch
        normalization layers, and activation layers. This compresses input data and generates low-dimensional
        feature vectors. On the other hand, the decoder consists of 5 transposed convolutional layers, batch
        normalization layers, and activation layers. This expands feature vectors back to their original shape
        and predicts fluid states at the next time step.
        Textbooks often say a convolution matrix is a discrete form of a convolution integral.
        That means it can represent differential operators.
        So a well-designed convolutional model can learn the flow dynamics.

        In this study, we looked at fluid flow in 2D bearing cavities. As you can see in this figure, we studied fluid
        that flows in a ring shape, just like cut ball bearings in 2D. We used commercial CFD software to
        calculate. The left animation shows how the fluid behaves according to CFD calculations, and the right

        Let me explain the data preprocessing.<br>
        1. The fluid was single-phase Newtonian with Reynolds number 400.<br>
        2. We got vorticity data from CFD, which we made normal with mean 0 and variance 1.<br>
        3. We filled the solid parts with zeros.<br>
        4. We also made the coordinate system rotate to keep the ball in the same place. This is because it's hard for
        the AI to learn when the boundary conditions change over time.<br>
        5. Also, we changed the cylinder shape data into rectangle shape using polar coordinates. This is the most
        important data preparation step in this study. This lets us meet the rectangle data shape rule that DL-ROM
        needs.

        Here we explain how we split the data and how we trained and tested the model.<br>
        1. We used 1000 snapshots from the CFD run. From these, 800 snapshots were used for training the model and 200
        were used for testing it.<br>
        2. The model takes 10 snapshots as input and tries to predict the 11th snapshot. During training, the model
        starts with random weights and then changes those weights step by step so its predictions get closer to the real
        CFD results.<br>
        3. During testing, we do not change the model — we only check how well its predictions match the real
        snapshots.<br>
        4. To measure the difference between the model and the CFD results, we used mean squared error (MSE). This
        number tells us, on average, how far the predicted values are from the real values.

        This shows the training results. The right graph shows how the error changes as we train the model.
        The horizontal axis shows training epochs, and the vertical axis shows MSE. The blue line shows
        error for training data, and the green line shows error for test data. We can see that the error for both
        datasets goes down as training moves forward. This means that DL-ROM is getting better at predicting fluid
        behavior. While the training data error decreases smoothly, the test data error goes up slightly in some parts.
        This is a sign of overfitting, but since both errors end up at similar levels, we think serious overfitting
        did not happen. We used GPU for training and testing. The computer specs are shown here.
        The computer is similar to a higher-end desktop PC. It has a fast multi-core CPU, a common gaming GPU,
        and enough RAM for training.<br>

        This shows the results of fluid simulation by DL-ROM. The top row shows CFD results, the middle
        row shows DL-ROM predictions, and the bottom row shows the differences between them. As you can see,
        DL-ROM predictions match very well with CFD results. Looking at the differences at the bottom, we can
        see that the differences are small in most areas.<br>
        Also, on the right we show how the error changes at each time step. As we expected, the error slowly gets bigger
        over time. This is because DL-ROM uses its own predictions as input for the next step, so small errors pile up.
        But overall, it keeps the errors low, which shows that DL-ROM can predict fluid behavior very accurately.<br>
        Also, please look at the calculation time. While CFD took about 800 minutes to calculate 1 second of fluid
        behavior, DL-ROM could do the same job in about 3 minutes. This means it's 260 times faster.<br>
        Such fast calculations let engineers try many more design ideas in the early stages of bearing development.

        Here is a summary of what we achieved. In this study, we successfully applied DL-ROM to 2D bearing fluid.
        For future work, we have several exciting directions.<br>
        First, we want to apply this to 3D bearing fluid. 3D cylindrical data can also be changed to rectangular data
        using cylindrical coordinates, similar to how we used polar coordinates in 2D. This will allow us to use DL-ROM
        for more realistic bearing designs.<br>
        Second, we want to work with non-Newtonian fluids and flows that have both air and oil. Bearings often use
        grease, which is a non-Newtonian fluid, so being able to simulate that will be very useful.<br>
        Finally, we want to find better ways to handle the solid parts inside the boundaries, instead of just filling
        them with zeros. This could help improve prediction accuracy even more.
        This concludes my presentation. NSK is actively exploring AI applications, and we welcome collaboration and
        advice from experts in this field.<br>
        1. Due to my limited English proficiency, I would prefer to answer individual questions after the presentation
        or via email. Thank you very much.
